This is the code for the TKDE 2018 Paper: [MV-RNN: A Multi-View Recurrent Neural Network for Sequential Recommendation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8534409).

## Usage

Our model is a little bit complicated and the annotations are in Chinese. If you would like to make a comparison, you can apply one of the variants of the model, called 'Con.' in this paper. It is easy to understand and implement.

## Requirements

- python
- Theano
